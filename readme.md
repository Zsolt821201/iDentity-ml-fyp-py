Identity is a Python Django web application that uses machine learning and facial recognition. This project seeks to invest in the growing market for AI applications by developing a cloud-based facial recognition system based on machine learning and deep learning. The project aims to create a centralized facial recognition time management system for targeting workplaces. The core of this project:

- Security – Ensure that data is delivered securely and that the program is not utilized outside the company’s PCs.Accuracy - To minimize the risk of the software mismatching a user’s face while also ensuring that it does so as correctly as possible, the purpose of this step is to guarantee that.
