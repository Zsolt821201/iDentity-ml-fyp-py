This final-year project proposes a web-based time management system with user identification that uses facial recognition technology to improve time tracking and enhance security in various places or locations. By capturing an image of the userâ€™s face and comparing it to registered images in the system, the system provides accurate authentication and time-tracking data and eliminates the need for traditional methods like punch cards or keycards.

This project presents an opportunity to develop skills in biometric technology, web development, and project management. It requires an understanding of facial recognition technology and the ability to design and implement a web-based system.
