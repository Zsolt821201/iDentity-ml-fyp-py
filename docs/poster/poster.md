## Introduction

Identity is a web-based time management system and user identification that uses facial recognition technology to improve time tracking and enhance security in various businesses developed as part of the final-year project for TUS.

The system provides accurate authentication and time-tracking data by capturing an image of the user’s face and comparing it to registered images in the system. It eliminates the need for traditional methods like punch cards or key cards.

This project presented an opportunity to develop skills in biometric technology, web development, and project management.

## Objectives

Identity will use a camera to capture a live image of the user's face and compare it to a registered image of the user already in the system to verify the user's identity.

Upon successful verification, the system will grant access and log the user’s entry/exit time providing accurate time tracking data for management. The system can be installed in various settings such as schools, hospitals, shops to enhance security and employee time tracking more efficiently.

The product objectives are:

- Simplifies the time tracking process
- Provide a reliable and user-friendly solution
- Reduces human error
- Increase workplace efficiency.

 Identity will improve workplace safety, accessibility, and covid compliance.

## Testing

During the testing process, unit testing was utilized to isolate and test individual components of the code for this application. This approach allowed for the verification of the application’s functionality in isolation, making it easier to identify and address any bugs that arose.

Throughout the testing phase, the OpenCV face recognition algorithm was tested to ensure that it correctly identified registered users and rejected unauthorized access attempts. The time logging feature was also tested to ensure that it accurately recorded user entry and exit times.

## Methodology

- Object Orientated Design [(OOD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design)
- Model View Controller (MVC)
- The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
- Dependency Injection (DI)

## Conclusion

The continued development of 'Identity' as a proof of concept holds significant promise for meeting the needs of different businesses.

Resources and time will be required for Big data Analysis and confidence testing to determine the optimal confidence value to use ‘Identity’ for high-security tier environments (Hospitals, Prisons).

Research into combating fraud with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

The science of image recognition will never stop. New and different techniques and challenges will give rise to new solutions. Continuous literature reviews and new solutions will always be required.
